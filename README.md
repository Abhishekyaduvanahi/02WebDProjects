My technical skills are complemented by practical experience in building diverse projects, from interactive Android apps to full-stack web applications. I have successfully developed and published apps on the Google Play Store and created a video subscription platform as part of my web development endeavors. Additionally, I have a growing YouTube channel, hatcoder, where I share content related to coding and development, reflecting my passion for continuous learning and improving communication skills. My achievements include solving over 400 programming problems and earning a certification in web development. Outside of work, I enjoy writing, stand-up comedy, playing chess, and exploring new interests.
